## Course Software Installation 

Now (March 2018) you can develop deep learning applications with Google Colaboratory (Colab) -on the free Tesla K80 GPU- using Keras and Tensorflow. Colab is a Google internal research tool for data science. They have released the tool sometime earlier to the general public with a noble goal of dissemination of machine learning education and research.
