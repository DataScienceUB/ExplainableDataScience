## Course Software Installation 

You can develop machine learning applications with Google Colaboratory (Colab). Colab is a Google internal research tool for data science. They have released the tool to the general public with the goal of dissemination of machine learning education and research.

Follow these steps in order to work in Colab:

+ **Connect** to https://colab.research.google.com/ (you will need a Google account).
+ **Create a folder** for your notebooks (this step isn’t totally necessary if you want to just start working in Colab). You can do that by going to your Google Drive and clicking `New` and then creating a new folder. Then, if you want, while you’re already in your Google Drive you can create a new Colab notebook. Just click `New` and drop the menu down to `More` and then select `Colaboratory`. Otherwise, you can always go directly to Google Colab.
+ **Set up a free GPU** (when using deep learning). Go to the `runtime` dropdown menu, selecting `change runtime type` and selecting GPU in the hardware accelerator drop-down menu.
+ Get coding!
